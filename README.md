# Elixir
Imagine an autograd library using Complex Numbers? We can have complex Transformers, Complex CNNs and what not. Imagine the applications...

That's what elixir is for. Nothing fancy. Theoritically, if it makes sense(once I'm able to convince myself), then I want to expand it not just to complex numbers, but for Quaternions(my favourite).Just some work on the mathematics, then we can also publish it as a package, and make complex(or better, quaternion) based modules and layers.

Needless to say, this project requires a lot of effort if want to make into something cool. PRs and discussions are always welcome. Let's see?
